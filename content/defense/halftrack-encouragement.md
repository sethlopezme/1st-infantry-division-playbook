Each time the commander uses encourage, use the 300 fuel bonus to build a halftrack. As garrisons will be built ~100m
away from the strong point, use the halftracks around the perimeter and/or interior of strongpoint. Strive for 3 on
point, but stagger them apart so no single bombing run can destroy all 3.
