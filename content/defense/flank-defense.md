The map is divided into 5 stages (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th points); each spans 2 rows/columns across the map. 
Each stage has 3 sectors (left/top, middle, and right/bottom); each containing 4 grid squares. 
If your defensive point is in the middle, build a garrison on each of the outside map edges in that stage of the map. 
If your defensive point is an outside point, place the first garrison at the opposite map edge, and the second ~400m
closer to your point.  Use these garrisons for radar and your QRF can spawn in behind an enemy flank and clear them out
from behind their push.
