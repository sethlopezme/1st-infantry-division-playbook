If your final strongpoint is an outside sector, build a garrison in each of the grid squares in the sector (4 total). 
Build triangulated garrisons in the middle sector (3 total). Build one garrison on the far edge of the map. If your
strongpoint is in the middle sector, build a garrison in each grid square in your sector (4 total). Then build one
garrison in each of the row/column lines outside the middle sector (4 total). In either case, try to have at least 2 of
these garrisons ~150-200m of an HQ so that you can push out the enemy if they try to camp an HQ, as well as maintain a
spawn if your strongpoint sector if that HQ gets locked out during an enemy capture.
