title = "Red Zone Spawn Denial"

+++
The map is divided into 5 stages (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th points); each spans 2 rows/columns across the map. Each
stage has 3 sectors (left/top, middle, and right/bottom); each containing 4 grid squares. This play focuses on defending
the two sectors of the map stage where your strong point is NOT located. If your strong point is an outside point,
assign 4 squads of 2 players to the middle sector, and 2 squads of 2 players to the opposite side sector. If your strong
point is the middle sector, assign 3 squads of 2 players to each adjacent sector. Have squads place their OPs in a
triangle or box ~100m spread apart from the center of the sector. Maintain 1-2 people in each grid square at all times
continuously patroling around. This will not deny enemy from spawning on half tracks or outposts, but it will lock out 
any red zone garrison attempts. Have 2 separate squads of 3 players to deploy around as needed to support areas of
engagement as identified.
