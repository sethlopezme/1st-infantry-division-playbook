Split your full squad of 6 into 2 squads of 3 people. Each consists of squad lead, support, and engineer. Designate a
point for fortifications; usually your second-last or last point. If you designate your third point, make sure it is
strategic as it will take much longer to resupply the point due to travel distance. Have command spawn a supply truck
for each SL, who will run supplies back and forth to point. Make sure a manpower node is built on point. Each engineer
puts down all blueprints as quickly as possible. Each support provides additional supplies when ready and builds each
blueprint. Then each player swaps roles. After both have used all blueprints, have the squad lead switch to engineer.
Try to build fortifications around the perimeter or outside of the strongpoint. Only build fortifications inside the
strongpoint if the point is a wide-open area or otherwise strategic.
